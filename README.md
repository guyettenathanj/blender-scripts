[Recursive Cubes Spinning](https://github.com/guyettenathanj/blender-scripts/blob/main/recursive-cube-animation.py)

Makes recursively smaller and smaller cubes, and makes them all spin around their parent object.

[Slowly transition between colors](https://github.com/guyettenathanj/blender-scripts/blob/main/color_changing_animation.py)

Adds keyframes to transition from one rgba color to another.

[Extrude randome face from sphere](https://github.com/guyettenathanj/blender-scripts/blob/main/extrude_random_faces_from_sphere.py)

Extrudes a random quad from a uv sphere. Currently it is possible that an extruded quad gets extruded again. Kind of a neat effect, maybe I'll add a control to flip between not extruding from child quads.
